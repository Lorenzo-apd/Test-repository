# Test-repository

## Purpose of this repository

The purpose of this repository is to be a playground for testing different types of programs and/or applications of tools and libraries for different languages, like:
- Python
- C#
- C++
- C
- Golang

## How this repository is organized

This repostitory is going to be divided into different folders for different languages.
Inside every folder, there will be subfolders containing all the projects of that specific language.


## License

This project uses the **GPL-3.0** (*GNU General Public License version 3.0*), a free and open source software license created by the Free Software Foundation (FSF). By using this license, I am committed to ensuring that my software remains free and open for others to use, modify, and distribute. 

### Benefits of using GPL-3.0

Some of the main benefits of using the GPL-3.0 license for my project include:

- **Strong copyleft protection:** The GPL-3.0 ensures that any modifications or derivative works based on my software must also be released under the GPL-3.0 and must include the source code. This helps to keep the project open for everyone to modify and use, and prevents others from using my software to create closed-source or proprietary applications.
- **Community collaboration:** By releasing my software under the GPL-3.0, I am promoting the principles of free and open source software, and encouraging others to contribute back to the community. This can lead to greater collaboration and innovation from my simple code, to more advanced code that could be useful for other projects.
- **Legal certainty:** The GPL-3.0 is a widely recognized and respected license in the open source community. By using a well-established license, I can help to ensure that my software is legally sound and that my users can understand and comply with the terms of the license without confusion.

### Potential drawbacks of using GPL-3.0

However, there are also some potential drawbacks to using the GPL-3.0 license for my project:

- **Compatibility with other licenses:** The strong copyleft nature of the GPL-3.0 can make it incompatible with other licenses, which could limit the potential uses of my software, but I don't think this work is going to be used in software with different licenses.
- **Potential for contributors to be deterred:** Some developers may be hesitant to contribute to a project that is released under the GPL-3.0, as it requires them to release their contributions under the same license. This could limit the pool of contributors and slow down development.

### Conclusion

Overall, I believe that the benefits of using the GPL-3.0 license for my project outweigh the potential drawbacks. By releasing my software under this license, I am promoting the principles of free and open source software, and contributing to a stronger, more collaborative community of developers and users. While my project may be a collection of random code that may not be important to the average programmer, I really hope making it more accessible is going to help others in need of example code.
